# 1. Product Context & Vision

## 1.1. Product Identity
- **Name:** Sermon-AI비서 (Sermon AI Assistant)
- **Tagline:** Professional AI-assisted homiletics workspace for the modern pastor.
- **Core Philosophy:** "Technology should not replace the Holy Spirit, but handle the 'heavy lifting' of research and structure so the pastor can focus on proclamation."

## 1.2. Problem Statement
Pastors face two conflicting realities:
1.  **The Need for Depth:** A good sermon requires deep exegetical study, theological accuracy, and thoughtful meditation.
2.  **The Lack of Time:** Administrative duties and emergency ministry often leave little time for sermon prep (e.g., the "Saturday Night Panic").

## 1.3. Solution Strategy
Sermon-AI비서 solves this by offering a flexible workflow:
1.  **Deep Mode:** A disciplined, step-by-step workflow (Planning → Exegesis → Meditation → Drafting → Manuscript) for thorough preparation.
2.  **Quick Mode:** An emergency generator that creates a full manuscript draft + structure + research summary instantly based on minimal input.
3.  **Blank Page:** A clean slate for pastors who want to start writing immediately without AI pre-generation.

## 1.4. Key Differentiators
- **Theological Profiling:** Unlike generic AI, this system respects the user's denomination (e.g., Presbyterian, Baptist) and preaching style.
- **Localization:** Full support for Korean context (Korean Sample Project, Hangeul UI).
- **Academic Rigor:** The UI and output style mimic an academic dossier/study environment.
- **Holistic Workflow:** Covers the entire lifecycle from raw text analysis to the final pulpit view.
- **Doctrinal Safety:** Built-in "Doctrinal Review" agents to prevent theological errors.

## 1.5. Target Audience (Persona)
- **Primary:** Senior Pastors, Assistant Pastors, Seminarians (Korean & English speaking).
- **Traits:** Theologically trained, value depth but are time-constrained, appreciate tools that respect their specific tradition.
